The overall settlement includes consideration totaling $15 million for the benefit of class members, including the payment from the company, and payments from certain of its present and former officers and directors, its former auditors, and the insurance companies that provided Computron with directors and officers liability insurance.  In return for the payments by the insurance companies, the settlement also resolves a separate lawsuit brought by the company against the insurance companies. The consolidated amended class action complaint alleged the Computron Software had falsely portrayed the financial condition of Computron.
